# gifosproject
Project for Full Stack Web Development course in Acamica, a coding academy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and my second coding project. The objective was to create a web page where you could see the current popular gifs and search for any gifs. The data from these was taken from the Giphy API. 
If your computer has a webcam you can also create your own gifs and upload them to the Giphy Server. 

We were not allowed to use any libraries for this project. Everything was done with HTML, CSS (via SASS) and Javascript. 
Responsive design not currently available but its on the way :)

Hope you like it!
